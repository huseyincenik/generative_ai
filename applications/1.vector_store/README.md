# 🔵 Vector Store in Python 🔵

This project demonstrates how to build a custom vector storage and retrieval system from scratch using Python. Whether you're involved in **machine learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, or **recommendation systems**, this Vector Store will help you understand key concepts like vector creation, indexing, and efficient vector searches.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

In this repository, you'll learn to:

- Create and manage vectors
- Build a custom Vector Store class
- Implement indexing for efficient vector retrieval
- Search for similar vectors based on input

## 💡 Key Concepts

1. **Vector Creation**: Learn how to represent data as vectors.
2. **Custom Vector Store**: Build a Python class to manage vectors.
3. **Efficient Indexing**: Implement indexing for quick vector retrieval.
4. **Vector Similarity Search**: Search for vectors that are most similar to a given query.

## 🔍 Example Use Case

We'll take a practical example where we store and search for vectors representing sentences. The steps include:

- Tokenizing text
- Creating vectors
- Using the Vector Store to search for similar sentences
